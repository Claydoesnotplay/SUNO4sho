# Musical Construction Adjectives - Definitions

## Temporal/Rhythmic

**syncopated** - Rhythmic emphasis placed on weak beats or off-beats rather than strong beats, creating unexpected accents that disrupt the expected metrical flow.

**polyrhythmic** - The simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythmic patterns or meters, such as triplets against duplets or 3:2 rhythmic relationships.

**rubato** - Flexible, expressive tempo with slight speeding up and slowing down, allowing the performer to stretch or compress time for emotional effect without losing overall pulse.

**staccato** - Notes performed short and detached from one another, with distinct separation between each sound.

**legato** - Notes performed smoothly and connected, with no perceptible silence between them.

**sustained** - Notes or sounds held continuously over time without interruption, maintaining steady pitch and tone.

**metric** - Music organized around a regular, recurring pattern of beats grouped into measures with identifiable strong and weak pulses.

**ametric** - Music without a regular beat or meter, where rhythmic organization is free-flowing or pulse is absent or obscured.

## Harmonic

**consonant** - Harmonies that sound stable, pleasant, and resolved, typically involving intervals like perfect fifths, major and minor thirds, and perfect octaves.

**dissonant** - Harmonies that sound tense, unstable, or harsh, creating a sense of need for resolution, typically involving intervals like major and minor seconds, tritones, and major sevenths.

**chromatic** - Using pitches outside the prevailing key or scale, incorporating all twelve tones of the chromatic scale through half-step motion.

**diatonic** - Using only the seven pitches of a major or minor scale without chromatic alterations.

**modal** - Based on modes (Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, etc.) rather than major/minor tonality, each with characteristic interval patterns and tonal centers.

**atonal** - Music without a tonal center or key, avoiding hierarchical pitch relationships and traditional harmonic function.

**polytonal** - The simultaneous use of two or more different keys or tonal centers at the same time.

**resolved** - Harmonic or melodic tension that has moved to a point of stability or rest, typically from dissonance to consonance.

## Textural

**homophonic** - A primary melodic line supported by chordal accompaniment, where all voices move with similar rhythm.

**polyphonic** - Multiple independent melodic lines occurring simultaneously, each with its own rhythmic and melodic identity.

**monophonic** - A single melodic line without accompaniment or harmony.

**contrapuntal** - Music constructed through counterpoint, with two or more independent melodic lines that are interdependent harmonically.

**dense** - Thick texture with many simultaneous musical layers, voices, or harmonic information occurring at once.

**sparse** - Thin texture with few musical elements, leaving space between sounds and using minimal simultaneous activity.

**layered** - Multiple distinct musical elements stacked upon one another, each maintaining individual character while contributing to the whole.

**heterophonic** - Simultaneous variation of a single melodic line, where performers play or sing the same melody with individual embellishments or slight variations.

## Timbral

**distorted** - Sound with intentional harmonic alteration or degradation, adding overtones and changing the original waveform character.

**filtered** - Sound processed to remove or emphasize specific frequency ranges, altering the spectral content.

**resonant** - Sound with emphasized natural frequencies, creating ringing or sustained harmonic emphasis at particular pitches.

**dry** - Sound without reverb or ambient effects, presented in an acoustically "dead" or close-miked manner.

**reverberant** - Sound with reflections and decay that simulate or enhance acoustic space, adding depth and ambience.

**saturated** - Sound pushed to the edge of or beyond its dynamic limit, creating harmonic richness or compression.

**compressed** - Dynamic range reduced so that loud and soft sounds are closer in volume, creating consistent intensity.

## Dynamic

**crescendoing** - Gradually increasing in volume or intensity over time.

**diminuendo** - Gradually decreasing in volume or intensity over time.

**accented** - Specific notes emphasized through increased volume, intensity, or attack compared to surrounding notes.

**articulated** - Clearly defined attack and release on individual notes, with deliberate shaping of note beginnings and endings.

**fortissimo** - Very loud, maximum intensity within the musical context.

**pianissimo** - Very soft, minimal intensity approaching silence.

## Structural

**repetitive** - Built on recurring musical material, patterns, or motifs that return exactly or with minimal variation.

**developmental** - Musical material that undergoes transformation, variation, fragmentation, or elaboration over time.

**sectional** - Organized into distinct, clearly delineated sections or blocks, often with contrast between them.

**through-composed** - Continuously evolving without significant repetition of large sections, each part presenting new material.

**cyclical** - Material that returns after departure, creating circular or recursive formal patterns.

**fragmented** - Built from small, disconnected musical cells or broken phrases rather than continuous lines.

**continuous** - Uninterrupted flow without clear breaks, pauses, or sectional divisions.

## Pitch/Melodic

**ascending** - Melodic motion moving upward in pitch.

**descending** - Melodic motion moving downward in pitch.

**stepwise** - Melodic motion by adjacent scale degrees (seconds), creating smooth, connected melodic lines.

**disjunct** - Melodic motion by leaps (intervals larger than a second), creating angular, disconnected lines.

**microtonal** - Using intervals smaller than a semitone, dividing the octave into more than twelve parts.

**pentatonic** - Based on a five-note scale, commonly used in folk music and avoiding semitone intervals.
